Discussed the layout of the UML diagram and possibility of having multiple weapons "boxes" to signify a reliance on weapons
On opposite sides of the diagram.
Discussed whether weapons levels should be able to be changed at the shop but decided it would undermine the benefit of picking up
new weapons.
Possibility of including stats in the inventory and the menu, enemies killed and time played
Discussed mechanics of the trance allies difference to the barracks allies
Discussed how shop overlay would appear on the screen
Discussed how weapon level should appear on the overlay, whether it should be on the image; appear on the overlay when you hover the mouse over it; or if the specs should appear when you right click the shop.\
Discussed the possibility of the number of laps till you can open the shop, this will appear seperate to the number of laps counter

1.7 Thursday 7-8:10
Decided on final style for pause screen (displaying game mode and goals only when game is paused)
Discussed how to draw item level on UI. 2 ideas that we came up with is overlaying text over the picture or just having 10 seperate pictures. Elliot emailed Matthew to ask about thais
Added several interfaces to UML diagram (for weapon, armour and enemies). Kevin will take over from Elliot and make more changes before we submit
Hugo and Elliot will take over from Kevin and tweak assumption criterias, as well as add story points and priorities to each user story
Eddy is working on redesigning pause menu, relocating card inventory and adding levels to items
Plan to meet up again on Friday (at about 3) for a final check to make sure everything is working
Everyone is going to add assumptions, and then we'll add them all in a big dump to limit unnecessary commits
Hugo will finalise the schedule for Milestone 2 based off the priorities of User Stories

2.7 Friday 10-11
We realised acceptance criteria need to be a lot more specific (e.g. show amount of gold dropped by enemies)
Spent an hour deciding on health, damage, gold drops, experience drops and item scaling
Went through forum to figure out why player could place vampire castle and zombie pits

Started with minutes for help session
how pathPosition is meant to work

discussed which patterns we are using in the 2nd stage

13.7 Tuesday 12-1
Discussed how allied soldiers would be displayed desided their would be an integerproperty that would 
store how many allied soldiers are alive and that many allied soldiers would be made visible
Discussed character gold would be stored as an integerproperty and be bound bidirectionally for the front end 
store and back gaining gold from fights
discussed how we would deal with merge conflicts caused by git

all be iterated through at time  the character passes through spawn
